<h1>Inspiration:</h1> 
</br>
For students coming to and living in Melbourne, it is a daunting task to live in a place that fulfils their requirements. For instance for some students living in a place with a good night life is integral in making their experience better while for others public transport accessibility is their biggest concern. As such we have come up with a solution in the form of website to tackle the problems and make the students living experience better.

<h1>What it does: </h1>
</br>
Our website OzRenting is primarily catered towards a niche market which is students and improving their living experience. It does that by providing them information such as top 10 suburbs in the surroundings of their Uni, how the rent in the suburbs have been fluctuating in the last 5 years, what sort of groceries they can get in the suburb and so on. Not only that but also it provides them access to discounts on several living expenses such as utility bills, internet bills, flight tickets etc.

<h1>How we built it: </h1>
</br>
 We built it by gathering the data from several open data portals such as data.gov.au and victorian police. For front end we have used Google maps API, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. We have used high-charts for visualisation to improve in understanding of the information collected.

<h1>Challenges we ran into:</h1>
</br>
One of the challenges we came across was to get refined data for the purpose and I believe it's going to be a continuous journey but we have plans to tackle it and improve the experience of our users, which is going to be the students.

<h1>Accomplishments we are proud of:</h1>
</br>
We have built a prototype that displays the idea that we have in mind successfully and with suggestions from everyone we definitely believe it is going to provide a better experience for students renting a place in Melbourne or thinking about cutting cost in their expenses.

<h1>What we learned:</h1>
</br>
 It's really integral to get feedback and so far we have been helped all throughout by the generous mentors and even the participants in UniHack which eventually helped us to built a successful project. Also we learned, to built something from scratch it requires equal dedication and contribution from every team member to develop something that solves a problem.

<h1>What's next for OzRenting:</h1> </br>
OzRenting will look up for partnering with different real-estate agent/brokers, utility providers, universities and international education agencies to improve the experience of the students coming from different nationalities as well as those who are already residing in Melbourne.
